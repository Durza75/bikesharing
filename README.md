Most rides last between 5 and 10 minutes, and then there is a an exponential decrease in ride length.

#### Figure 2: *Checkout Times by Gender*

## Summary
The data shows that the Citibike system in NYC is used the most between 8-9am and 5-7pm on weekdays. These times are prime commuting hours, indicating that citibikes are used most as an alternate means of commuting. This makes sense in NYC, since it is a dense city. For citibike to make sense in Des Moines as well, one would have to take into account the population density of the city and what the average commuting distances are. If most people in Des Moines have a 30+ minute commute by car, then it would not make sense for them to use a citibike instead. Additionally, what is the average age in Des Moines? In NYC, the the younger generations are the ones who use citibike the most (Figure 2), and if Des Moines is made up mostly of a younger generation, then it would make sense to start a ride sharing business. Such data can be found in census information.

Additionally, the data from the NYC citibike program indicates that males tend to take advantage of the program more than females do. According to Figure 9 below, 65% of the riders are male, 25% are female, and 10% are unknown. In order to make a better decision on whether to invest or not invest, it would be advised to determine the gender breakdown of the population of Des Moines.
